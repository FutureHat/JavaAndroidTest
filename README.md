# JavaAndroidTest
The Unit Exercise is in the folder of WarmUpExercise
  - The WarmUpExercise class contains exercise A, B, and C
  - It is a one program with 4 functions that can check if it is a palindrome, can check if it is a prime number, and a function that
  sorted that Students based on their Name and Grade
  - The Student Class is the model or constructor that used for the sorting of students
The main app contains the API Integration test
  - The android application has a availability to GET the data from the API that I use from Mocky.io 
  - This is API path that I create (http://www.mocky.io/v2/5e4e5fed2f00004e0016a69f)
  - I also apply the sorting of the player based on their scores from highest to lowest and display the result to the Recyclerview
  - The android application can also cache a data that I got from the API to still see the data even if in offline
  - I also used ItemTouchHelper for delete the data. Just swipe it LEFT or RIGHT and it will automatically delete the data that you swipe
